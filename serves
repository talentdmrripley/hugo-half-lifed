Am I happy at my job? Does my career challenge me month after month? How does my job make me feel? These are just a few questions we ask ourselves as we navigate our careers. 
What if I told you a simple daily score could help you work out how you feel about work?
Habit trackers are a cornerstone of Bullet Journaling. #BuJo users track all kinds of habits, mine being fairly simple: reading, working out, and work happiness.
#### How did I feel when I left work today? 
Work Happiness is a question and a score, tracked daily:
3 - Perfect 
2 - Good
1 - Not good 
0 - Defeated

The work happiness score is based on volleyball Serve Receive stats, which evaluate a player's overall skill receiving a serve and passing it effectively to set up the offense. 
*3 means the pass was advanced with minimal adjustment for the setter to set up the attack.*
*2 was pushed forward to the setter but the options for attack are limited.* 
*1 means the pass was not good and the team is scrambling to keep the ball in play.* 
*0 as the name suggests, is a shanked pass, an error, the ball soars out of bounds or can't be reached by teammates.*
Like serves, workdays come at us five times a week. We have eight hours  to win the day or wither to defeat. Perfect days, good days, bad days, gut-punching days. Those are the data points.
#### Work Days
Keep in mind a day is just a day and can never tell the whole story. Reflect a bit and give the day a score. That's all. It's the daily tracking that shapes workplace happiness. My journal is mostly 2s -- good days. Occasionally, some 3s, occasionally some 1s, but no 0s as of yet and that's fine with me. 
In 2019, my personal workplace happiness averaged 1.98 over 12 months. Almost 2, essentially. That's pretty good. Daily, there were far more 2s than 1s. Good days. It means I was happy at my job in 2019, and have the data to prove it.
If my score ever drops below 1.5 (the 1s are overtaking the 2s), it might be time make serious adjustments, find out what's really going on, or time to move on.  x
