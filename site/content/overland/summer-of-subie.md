Let's be honest: 2020 has been a whack year. The pandemic has cut a wide path across everything we classify as "normal." Work for those who work, school for those who school, family stuff, personal stuff, and everything in between is now a struggle. 

Social distancing is the new norm. Doing things--almost anything--must be done while distanced. Okay.

Enter the Crosstrek, and what great timing it was.
