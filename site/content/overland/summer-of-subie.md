Let's be honest: 2020 has been a whack year. The pandemic cut a wide path across everything we classify as "normal." Work for those who work, school for those who school, family stuff, personal stuff, and everything in between is now a struggle.

We usually do a major trip in the summer. Cruise, Europe, Hawaii. Something. Not this year. "Nope," cheers, your pal, COVID-19. Social distancing is the new norm. Doing things--almost anything--must be done while distanced. Okay.

Enter the Crosstrek, and what great timing.

We've done more local vacationing than ever. Two camping trips, multiple day trips, drive arounds, gravel road galivants, dirt road drives, farm field forrays, log road laps, creek road caravans. It's all incredible!

Our Subaru might just be a car, but it's more than that: it's our COVID-19 coping mechanism. It's our open invitation to stop, breathe, and rediscover more of the ongoing intrigue around us.

Some of my favorite stops are below:
