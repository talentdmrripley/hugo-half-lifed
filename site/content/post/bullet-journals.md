Back in January I downloaded Ryder Carroll's book about [Bullet Journaling](https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/ref=asc_df_0525533338/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312104274912&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4302620717105397799&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033767&hvtargid=aud-798931705416:pla-524552078099&psc=1). 

> For years Ryder Carroll tried countless organizing systems, online and off, but none of them fit the way his mind worked. Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective.

I decided to give it a try. And while the book is straightforward with a great framework for getting started, you have to find your own way with it. 

The #BuJo hashtag is ripe with inspiration, ideas, hacks, colorful layouts, and "trackers" for organizing your life and logging particulars of note. Thousands of people share their layouts, make videos, and more. Check out the results in this [#BuJo Instagram search](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bujo/) with 3,553,046 posts.

It can be intimidating if you decide you have to match this level of creativity to make your #BuJo experience successful. My suggestion is don't try. Your style and creativity can emerge on its own. Again, find your own way with Bullet Journaling.

#### My 7 takeaways
1. Be consistent—There's great satisfaction in the ritual of Bullet Journaling.
2. Trackers—You can track almost anything. How did I feel when I left work? Did I exercise today? Did I read? What did I eat?
3. Writing things down—There's permanency in the act of writing something down. Disconnecting from the digital world might sound old-fashioned but it's refreshing in a surprising way. I encourage everyone to try it.
4. Perspective shift–Instead of moving through life at break-neck speed, Bullet Journaling turns you into an observer of your life and all the things you care about.
5. Embrace your individuality—It's your Bullet Journal; you might be surprised what you learn about yourself and your particular style.
6. No pressure—don't beat yourself up if you miss a week. If you started with the basics and stayed with it for a bit, it shouldn't be long until you're back at it again.
7. Journaling—Since it's in the name and all, journaling your life is easy and organized throughout the year. How was that trip? How's work going? What's going on at home?

I definitely recommend Bullet Journaling, especially if you're looking to connect with your life a bit more. I don't keep a digital calendar for my personal life; it's all in my Bullet Journal now.
